# ðŸ–– Hello World, I'm Miszo

I'm Miszo Radomski, a passionate software engineer based in Poland. I've been working in the tech industry for several years now, with a focus on delivering high-quality software solutions to clients across various domains, including eCommerce, HR, and finance.

My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to pursue a career in software engineering. I've worked on numerous projects throughout my career, and I take pride in my ability to develop clean, maintainable, and scalable code using modern technologies like React, TypeScript, Next.js, Azure, Docker, and Kubernetes. I'm able to leverage my experience in UX design to make informed decisions that are user-centric, and ensure that the products I work on are easy to use and provide value to the end user.

In my career, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of companies, from small startups to multinational corporations. Throughout it all, I've found that my true passion lies in working with product companies that are dedicated to creating solutions that help people in meaningful ways. I enjoy being part of a team that is invested in the end-user and works tirelessly to create solutions that meet their needs.

While I've worked in consulting in the past, I find that my skills and experience are best suited for product companies. I believe that my ability to focus on the user experience and attention to detail make me a valuable asset to any team working on a product that has a positive impact on people's lives.

Outside of work, I'm a big football enthusiast, and I enjoy watching Arsenal and playing with my friends. I must admit that I don't play as much as I used to. However, I'm still a big fan and enjoy watching games whenever I can. I believe my love for football has helped me develop valuable skills like teamwork, communication, and adaptability, which have been crucial in my professional life as well.

On a more personal note, in February 2023 I've discovered that I have mild ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). It's been a journey of self-discovery for me, but it has also helped me understand and appreciate my unique perspective and strengths.

Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at Housecall Pro, where I develop web applications and deliver top-notch solutions. Before that, I worked with several product companies, where I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and build my skills as a software engineer.

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills, and I believe my experience and passion for technology make me an excellent candidate for any software engineering role.
